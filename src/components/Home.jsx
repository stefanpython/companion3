      <p>“No man is an island, no man lives alone.” - John Donne</p>

      <p>
        Welcome to The Confidential Companion, the place where you can be
        yourself, in privacy, with real people ready to listen to you and be
        there when you need them the most.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is a fact that we live and feed on social media and in this process,
        we forget who we truly are, living our lives based on its expectations
        of us. We have our responsibilities to our jobs, business, families and
        friends and very seldom we take the time for ourselves and our own
        needs.
      </p>

      <p>
        At <b>The Confidential Companion</b> we aim to create meaningful
        connections with you, to listen to your worries and let you be yourself.
        We are objective, non judgemental and we have no hidden agenda or
        expectations of you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our goal is to be there for those who need companionship and genuine
        friendship, to make a real difference through empathy, care, compassion
        and truth.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project is an alternative to the so-called friendship on social
        media and it is one hundred percent confidential. Yes, you can choose to
        be seen by us or not and no, we do not care about your status or gender
        and so on.
      </p>

      <p>So, let us tell you about ourselves.</p>
